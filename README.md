# Occupancy-Detection
In this project we developed a deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) for counting the number of people in an image. This has a lot of applications in many areas like occupancy detection, surveillance etc. We deployed the model on a server, as deep learning models can be highly computationally intensive. Though it was not necessary in our case we did it to ease the scale up.
