This directory contains 
1) ModelTraining.ipynb
2) ModelTesting.ipynb

ModelTraining.ipynb trains the model and saves it to the drive.
ModelTesting.ipynb is for testing the model and comparing its performance with a pretrained model.

To run both ModelTraining.ipynb and ModelTesting.ipynb,
1) Upload the notebooks to the drive.
2) A folder containing the training data is already shared to you by "Mallidi Poorna Siva Rama Reddy" with name "Unbiased_Enthusiasts".
3) Right click on the folder and select "Add shortcut to drive".
4) Then select "My Drive".

Then both the notebooks can be run without any changes.

The folder Unbiased_Enthusiasts contains training data, saved model (our model) and pretrained model.

Contributions:
For every line of both the codes ModelTraining.ipynb and ModelTesting.ipynb,  all three of us have discussed and have done pair programming.
We promise you that all of us have equal understanding and contribution in the project proceedings.
